Our team has come up with the a project on **Home Automation**. This project is a built with both hardware and software material. 

## Hardwares
We have built a circuit on Home Automation using Aurduino UNO and other cicuitry parts. Below is the circuit diagram:

The functions which our Home Automation project executes:
* **Theft Alarm:** This alarm buzzes if an unknown person's presence is detected by the sensor in its vicinity.
* **Fire Alert:** Gas sensor is used to check the gas level in air. If it exceeds a limit then this alarm buzzes.
* **Remote/Voice controlled lights:** We can control the switching on/off of a light using a remote or voice. Moreover, we are capable of adjusting its intensity.
* **Aumtomated Fan:** Fans which are rmote/voice controlled for start and stop. Moreover, they adjust their speed in accordance with the temperature in the surroundings.
* **Automated Windows:** These windows are adjustable as they know how much to open based on the amount of sunshine reaching us.
* **Automated Doors:** These doors are controlled using IR sensors. if a person approaches a door then it will open on its own.
The C++ files used to program the Hardware circuit has also been included in this repository.

## Softwares
The software part of our project consists of an **.ipynb file** where we executed Speech Recognition Model using google technology. This will make our Home Automation device operate on speech commands or it can be done manually (Just like Amazon's Home Automation Alexa works). The difference between Amazon's Home automation or any other Home automation device is not in it's software part but it's in the Hardware device. As de\iscussed earlier it can perform much more complicated functions like adjusting fan speed or sending an alert alarm if Gas amount in the house rise above a particular level (for fire safety) and much more.

## The Project as a Whole
The Software and Hardware parts of this Home Automation project is to be implemented together using **IoT-based Cloud services** (IoT - Internet of Things). Since, cloud services are pricely we werem't able to include it.
